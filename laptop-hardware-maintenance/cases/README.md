# Maintenance Cases

This directory contains multiple laptop maintenance and
troubleshooting case studies, each documented as a separate
and independent case.

Each case represents a real-world maintenance activity
performed on a specific device, with clearly defined scope,
actions taken, and results.

## Structure
Each case is organized in its own directory and includes
documentation such as diagnostics, procedure, and results.
