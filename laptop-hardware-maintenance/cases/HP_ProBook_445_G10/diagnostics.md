## Initial Condition

- Visible dust accumulation inside the cooling system
- Reduced airflow through the heatsink
- Increased operating temperatures under load

## Assessment

The observed dust buildup and degraded thermal compound
were identified as the primary causes of reduced cooling efficiency.
